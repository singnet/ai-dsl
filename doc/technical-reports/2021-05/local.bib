	abstract = {There has been significant interest in recent months in finding new ways to implement composable and modular effectful programs using handlers of algebraic effects. In my own previous work, I have shown how an algebraic effect system (called effects) can be embedded directly in a dependently typed host language. Using dependent types ought to allow precise reasoning about programs; however, the reasoning capabilities of effects have been limited to simple state transitions which are known at compile-time. In this paper, I show how effects can be extended to support reasoning in the presence of run-time state transitions, where the result may depend on run-time information about resource usage (e.g. whether opening a file succeeded). I show how this can be used to build expressive APIs, and to specify and verify the behaviour of interactive, stateful programs. I illustrate the technique using a file handling API, and an interactive game.},

	abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

We give a translation from DFOL to FOL formalized as an institution comorphism and show that it admits the model expansion property. This property together with the borrowing theorem implies the soundness of borrowing --- a result that enables us to reason about entailment in DFOL by using automated tools for FOL. In addition, the translation permits us to deduce properties of DFOL such as completeness, compactness, and existence of free models from the corresponding properties of FOL, and to regard DFOL as a fragment of FOL. We give an example that shows how problems about DFOL can be solved by using the automated FOL prover Vampire. Future work will focus on the integration of the translation into the specification and translation tool HeTS.",

In this paper we show how a well known and effective verification technique, model checking, can be generalized to deal with multi-agent systems. This paper explores a particular type of multi-agent system, in which each agent is viewed as having the three mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D), and intention (I). We use a multi-modal branching-time logic BDICTL, with a semantics that is grounded in traditional decision theory and a possible-worlds framework. A preliminary implementation of the approach shows promising results.}
