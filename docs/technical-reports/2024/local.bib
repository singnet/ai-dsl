Type systems for the pi-calculus are proposed where newly declared (restricted) names are annotated with spatial process properties, predicating on those names, that are expected to hold in the scope of the declaration. Types are akin to ccs terms and account for the process abstract behavior and “shallow” spatial structure. Type checking relies on spatial model checking, but properties are checked against types rather than against processes. Type soundness theorems ensure that, for a certain class of spatial properties, well-typed programs are also well annotated, in the sense that processes in the scope of any restriction do satisfy the corresponding annotation at run-time. The considered class of properties is rather general. Differently from previous proposals, it includes both safety and liveness ones, and is not limited to invariants. We also elaborate a distinction between locally and globally checkable properties.}

In my own previous work, I have shown how an algebraic effect system (called effects) can be embedded directly in a dependently typed host language. Using dependent types ought to allow precise reasoning about programs; however, the reasoning capabilities of effects have been limited to simple state transitions which are known at compile-time. In this paper, I show how effects can be extended to support reasoning in the presence of run-time state transitions, where the result may depend on run-time information about resource usage (e.g. whether opening a file succeeded). I show how this can be used to build expressive APIs, and to specify and verify the behaviour of interactive, stateful programs. I illustrate the technique using a file handling API, and an interactive game.},

	abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

We give a translation from DFOL to FOL formalized as an institution comorphism and show that it admits the model expansion property. This property together with the borrowing theorem implies the soundness of borrowing --- a result that enables us to reason about entailment in DFOL by using automated tools for FOL. In addition, the translation permits us to deduce properties of DFOL such as completeness, compactness, and existence of free models from the corresponding properties of FOL, and to regard DFOL as a fragment of FOL. We give an example that shows how problems about DFOL can be solved by using the automated FOL prover Vampire. Future work will focus on the integration of the translation into the specification and translation tool HeTS.",

In this paper we show how a well known and effective verification technique, model checking, can be generalized to deal with multi-agent systems. This paper explores a particular type of multi-agent system, in which each agent is viewed as having the three mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D), and intention (I). We use a multi-modal branching-time logic BDICTL, with a semantics that is grounded in traditional decision theory and a possible-worlds framework. A preliminary implementation of the approach shows promising results.}

abstract = {Functions are essential building blocks of information retrieval and information management. However, efforts implementing these functions are fragmented: one function has multiple implementations, within specific development contexts. This inhibits reuse: metadata of functions and associated implementations need to be found across various search interfaces, and implementation integration requires human interpretation and manual adjustments. An approach is needed, independent of development context and enabling description and exploration of functions and (automatic) instantiation of associated implementations. In this paper, after collecting scenarios and deriving corresponding requirements, we (i) propose an approach that facilitates functions’ description, publication, and exploration by modeling and publishing abstract function descriptions and their links to concrete implementations; and (ii) enable implementations’ automatic instantiation by exploiting those published descriptions. This way, we can link to existing implementations, and provide a uniform detailed search interface across development contexts. The proposed model (the Function Ontology) and the publication method following the Linked Data principles using standards, are deemed sufficient for this task, and are extensible to new development contexts. The proposed set of tools (the Function Hub and Function Handler) are shown to fulfill the collected requirements, and the user evaluation proves them being perceived as a valuable asset during software retrieval. Our work thus improves developer experience for function exploration and implementation instantiation.}

AI should be used more widely but won't be unless developers can trust adaptive, nondeterministic, or complex AI systems. Verification and validation is one method used by software analysts to gain that trust. AI systems have features that make them hard to check using conventional V&V methods. Nevertheless, as we show in this chapter, there are enough alternative readily-available methods that enable the V&V of AI software.}

abstract="One possible way to deal with large theories is to have a good selection method for relevant axioms. This is confirmed by the fact that the largest available first-order knowledge base (the Open CYC) contains over 3 million axioms, while answering queries to it usually requires not more than a few dozen axioms. A method for axiom selection has been proposed by the first author in the Sumo INference Engine (SInE) system. SInE has won the large theory division of CASC in 2008. The method turned out to be so successful that the next two years it was used by the winner as well as by several other competing systems. This paper contains the presentation of the method and describes experiments with it in the theorem prover Vampire.",

abstract = "The pi-calculus differs from other models of communicating behaviour mainly in its treatment of mobility. The movement of a piece of data inside a computer program is treated exactly the same as the transfer of a message - or indeed an entire computer program - across the internet. One can also describe networks which reconfigure themselves. The calculus is very simple but powerful; its most prominent ingredient is the notion of a name. Its theory has two important ingredients: the concept of behavioural (or observational) equivalence, and the use of a new theory of types to classify patterns of interactive behaviour. The internet, and its communication protocols, fall within the scope of the theory just as much as computer programs, data structures, algorithms and programming languages. This book is the first textbook on the subject; it has been long-awaited by professionals and will be welcomed by them, and their students.",
